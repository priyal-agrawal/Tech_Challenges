# Challenge 3

## Problem Statement
We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
 
Example Inputs 
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}} 
key = a/b/c 
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z 
value = a

## Source Code
The code is written in Python language, which takes two inputs from user. One is nested object and another is key to find.
It finds the value associated with that key.

## Tests
