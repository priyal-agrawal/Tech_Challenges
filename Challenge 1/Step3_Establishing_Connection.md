# Connect to a VM from the internet : PowerShell
To get the public IP address of the VM, use Get-AzPublicIpAddress.

This example returns the public IP address of the myVm1 VM:
```
$ip = @{
    Name = 'myVM1'
    ResourceGroupName = 'CreateVNetQS-rg'
}
Get-AzPublicIpAddress @ip | select IpAddress
```
Open a command prompt on your local computer. Run the mstsc command. Replace <publicIpAddress> with the public IP address returned from the last step:

``` 
  mstsc /v:<publicIpAddress>
  
```

1. If prompted, select Connect.

2. Enter the user name and password you specified when creating the VM.

3. Select OK.

4. You may receive a certificate warning. If you do, select Yes or Continue.
